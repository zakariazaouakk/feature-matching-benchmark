# Feature Matching Benchmark

**Authors:** Zakaria Zaouak, Salma Azzimani, Lina Toumi

This project benchmarks local feature extractors (SuperPoint, DISK, SIFT) with the LightGlue matcher on a pair of images.  

It also evaluates the robustness of SuperPoint + LightGlue under image transformations such as rotation, brightness, and blur.  

Notebook tested on Google Colab.
