# 🔍 Feature Matcher Pro

Feature Matcher Pro is an interactive **Streamlit application** for benchmarking and visualizing **local feature extraction and matching** methods on image pairs.  
It compares **learning-based approaches** (SuperPoint, DISK + LightGlue) with the **classical SIFT** baseline, while providing **accurate inference timing** and clear visual results.
